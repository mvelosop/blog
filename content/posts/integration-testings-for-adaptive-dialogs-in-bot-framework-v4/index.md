This is the first article in a series about Adaptive Dialogs in Bot Framework v4. I'm not sure how many posts it'll be so I'll leave it open-ended and update this list as needed.

1. **Integration Testing for Adaptive Dialogs in Bot Framework v4** (This article)

## TL;DR;

In this article we get started with Adaptive Dialogs, setting a focus on integration testing, to help you accelerate bot development.

The [Adaptive Dialogs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/bot-service/bot-builder-adaptive-dialog-introduction?view=azure-bot-service-4.0) technology includes the powerful [Adaptive Expressions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/bot-service/bot-builder-concept-adaptive-expressions?view=azure-bot-service-4.0) but there isn't a good-enough tooling support for Adaptive Expressions in Visual Studio, like Intellisense, so you end up **needing** tests to make sure your bot works as expected.

In a way, it's much like working with Javascript in Notepad but it's worth it!
